##### random intro
# Hi :D This file got placed in your home directory (~) because you ran the install.sh script.
# Please edit, no.. you have to edit! - this file to suite your needs. Delete this comment, etc.
# If you wanna check out what new helpers got added to the 'system/files/shellrc' default,
# with vscode you could for example do: `code --diff ~/shellrc ~/invita/system/files/shellrc`
# Also check out our recommended packages from `system/dependencies` with i.e. `wajig show PKG`
echo Hi! :D from shellrc



##### WSL 2
# so you can `cd $windows` or `mv $windows/Downloads/1.jpg ./` 
windows=/mnt/c/Users/Hermann

# when placing files from windows in linux, they are owned by root.
# fix all files recursively by running `my-files` in the directory 
alias my-files='sudo chown $USER:$USER -R ./'

# `export` environment variables, from a .env file, into the current shell process.
# WARNING: This can be dangerous, DONT RUN MORE THEN ONCE.
# Because it does not "unset" previously exported vars, as one might expect.
# Generally it is better to set your env variables manually one by one, per shell session.
