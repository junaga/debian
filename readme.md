I use the [Debian](https://debian.org/) operating system _interactively_ (not as a server) almost everywhere.

- on bare metal, and VMs
- as VM on _Windows subsystem for Linux_
  - `cmd.exe` -> `wsl --install -d debian`
- as [devcontainer on github.com](https://github.com/features/codespaces)

The goal on every platform is the same, I need a working development environment. A _dev box_ or _dev container_, to write, test, debug and deploy software and apps.

## Why I use Debian

### 1. It's a [free](https://www.debian.org/intro/free) and open source, [copyleft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft) licensed (GPL), Linux software distribution

@Fireship has a [great 10 minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShcR4Zfc6Dw) that explains what a Linux distro is.

Linux > Windows. period. If you think differently, stop reading my files, turn off your computer, and go sell it. Also fuck you. No for real, Windows is for gaming but Linux is for working.

### 2. It's tiny and lightweight

- ~200 packages in new install
- ~500MB in new install (with docs, i18n and `systemd`)
- 2GB storage and 500MB memory, [system requirements](https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/amd64/ch03s04.en.html)

### 3. It's huge and powerfull

- [~60.000 packages](https://packages.debian.org/stable/) make up the distribution
- runs on x86, x86-64, ARM, [everywhere](https://www.debian.org/ports/)
- [is the upstream of a lot of linux](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/Linux_Distribution_Timeline_21_10_2021.svg), like _Raspberry Pi OS_.

### 4. It's a server system

Most servers on the web are Debian based Linux servers. There are a lot of `@google.com` email addresses of Debian package maintainers.

Debian is the _universal operating system_. You can run VMs in the public cloud, game servers (like Minecraft) and containers for app backends. There is no support for "Arch Linux" [in any CI/CD pipeline](https://github.com/ligurio/awesome-ci) to build-test-deploy an app or software.

### 5. It's stable.

Software is tested for years before it is included in the Debian stable branch. With a new release of Debian coming around roughly every 24 months. Unlike for example rolling releases "Arch Linux", which is pretty unstable. If you need `nodejs` version 18 and not version 12. Just install it manually, and carry the script to install it with you. forever.

More reasons on [debian.org/intro/why_debian](https://www.debian.org/intro/why_debian)

Basically it works, is stable and is found everywhere in the cloud. The possibly best thing about Debian, is that it is _boring_, without any weird features. It's the tool for the job.

## The `setup.bash` script

After installing Debian on any platform, I configure the system

- remove some artifacts in the filesystem
- install packages with `apt` and `npm` ([install/upgrade.bash](./install/upgrade.bash))
- copy [home/](./home/) to `$HOME/`

```sh
cd $HOME
# Clone or download https://github.com/junaga/debian
sudo bash -e debian/setup.bash
# confirm `$HOME/` replacement
```
